# ClanWars

Online card game with antique theme for multiple players. I created this game as my bachelor thesis. The game is implemented in Java and GUI is created in JavaFX. 
It is a game for multiple players that can be played online via a network. Clients communicate with the server via sockets. 
[Here](https://github.com/MartinPoluch/ClanWars/files/6870119/Bakalarska.praca.-.Martin.Poluch.pdf) you can read the theoretical part of my bachelor thesis that describes the design and implementation of this game.
